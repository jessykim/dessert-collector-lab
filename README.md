## Background & Description
Welcome to **SWEET TOOTH**!<br /> 
Do you have a sweet tooth? If yes, we're here to help you keep track of all your favorite desserts and recipes you may find online. You can also create a list of locations - or 'sweet spots' - where you can find your listed dessert. Feel free to include all kinds of desserts, ranging from baked goods to frozen treats. Enjoy! 🍦

Sweet Tooth was built as my final project at General Assembly. The full-stack reference application was required to be built using Django, PostgreSQL, Python and functionally perform CRUD operations.

As a lover of desserts, with an interest in baking, I chose to build this application for those of similar interests who may want to keep track of their favorite dessert places and recipes.
